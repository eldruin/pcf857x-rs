This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the PCF8574, PCF8574A and PCF8575 I2C I/O expanders,
based on the [`embedded-hal`] traits.

This driver allows you to:
- Set all the outputs to `0` or `1` at once. See `set()`.
- Read selected inputs. See `get()`.
- Set all the outputs repeatedly looping through an array. See `write_array()`.
- Read selected inputs repeatedly filling up an array. See `read_array()`.
- Split the device into individual input/output pins. See `split()`.

## The devices
The devices consist of 8 or 16 quasi-bidirectional ports, IÂ²C-bus interface, three
hardware address inputs and interrupt output. The quasi-bidirectional port can be
independently assigned as an input to monitor interrupt status or keypads, or as an
output to activate indicator devices such as LEDs.

The active LOW open-drain interrupt output (INT) can be connected to the interrupt logic
of the microcontroller and is activated when any input state differs from its corresponding
input port register state.

## Usage

[driver-examples]: https://github.com/eldruin/driver-examples

```rust
extern crate embedded_hal;
extern crate linux_embedded_hal;
extern crate pcf857x;

use linux_embedded_hal::I2cdev;
use pcf857x::{Pcf8574, PinFlag, SlaveAddr};

fn main() {
    let dev = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1").unwrap();
    let address = SlaveAddr::default();
    let mut expander = Pcf8574::new(dev, address);
    let output_pin_status = 0b1010_1010;
    expander.set(output_pin_status).unwrap();

    let pins_to_be_read = PinFlag::P0 | PinFlag::P7;
    let status = expander.get(&pins_to_be_read).unwrap();

    println!("Input pin status: {}", status);
}
```
