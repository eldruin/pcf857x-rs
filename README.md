# Rust PCF857x I/O Expanders Driver [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/pcf857x.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/pcf857x) [![Docs](https://docs.rs/pcf857x/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/pcf857x)

This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the PCF8574, PCF8574A and PCF8575 I/O expanders,
based on the [`embedded-hal`](https://github.com/japaric/embedded-hal) traits.

This driver allows you to:
- Set all the outputs to `0` or `1` at once.
- Read selected inputs.
- Set all the outputs repeatedly looping through an array.
- Read selected inputs repeatedly filling up an array.
- Split the device into individual output pins.

## The devices
The devices consist of 8 or 16 quasi-bidirectional ports, IÂ²C-bus interface, three
hardware address inputs and interrupt output. The quasi-bidirectional port can be
independently assigned as an input to monitor interrupt status or keypads, or as an
output to activate indicator devices such as LEDs.

The active LOW open-drain interrupt output (INT) can be connected to the interrupt logic
of the microcontroller and is activated when any input state differs from its corresponding 
input port register state.
